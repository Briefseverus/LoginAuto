This code is a Java program that logs into Facebook using a list of email addresses and passwords stored in an Excel file. It uses the Selenium WebDriver library to automate the login process in a Chrome browser.

The program reads the email and password values from the Excel file and enters them into the respective input fields on the Facebook login page. It then clicks the login button and waits for the page to load.

If the login is successful, the program navigates to the Facebook homepage and saves the user's cookies to a text file. If the login fails due to a checkpoint challenge, the program saves the email and password to another text file for later review.

The program uses the Java AWT Robot class to simulate mouse clicks at specific screen coordinates to bypass Facebook's automated detection of bot activity.
